## How to Use

### Step 1: Connect to Microsoft Graph
Run the script and authenticate when prompted. The script uses `Connect-MgGraph` to establish a session with the required scopes.

### Step 2: Choose an Option
The interactive menu provides the following options:
1. **Display Policies in Terminal**: View a summary of Conditional Access Policies in the console.
2. **Generate HTML Report**: Create a detailed report with policy configurations and recommendations.
3. **Export Policies to JSON**: Save policies in a JSON format for backup or import.

### Example Usage
#### Terminal Display
```plaintext

```

#### HTML Report
The script generates a report that includes policy details and recommendations in a professional HTML format.

#### JSON Export
Export all or selected policies to JSON for reuse or archiving.

### Step 3: Review the Output
